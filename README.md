Redmine API Plugin for Sublime Text 3
=====================================

This plugin is under development and not in any way ready to use yet. 

The idea is to provide a faster way (browser-free) to access and perform the most common actions in [Redmine].

- List projects
- List issues
- Edit issue (change status, progress)
- Add time entry

About
-----

This plugin is heavily based on [PyRedmineWS] by [ianepperson] and [Sublime-Text-Redmine-Plugin] by [blakeanderson].
Their work is the base idea for this project and I'm using [ianepperson] library in this plugin.

Currently, one has to access Redmine and go to the project page, access the issue link and if wanted: edit, add a time entry, change the status, etc. This takes the programmer a lot of time and distracts him from the work. With the plugin, one can do all this actions from Sublime, using its nice interface and Redmine API as communication.

I'll try to set a first version soon, probably based on [blakeanderson] plugin, to list the user open issues. After this I'll keep implementing more functionality based on order of actions and add the pictures here.

Help

If you are interested in this plugin, to help the development, or just contribute with ideas, bugs found, code improvement or anything at all, please DO tell me! I'm not a python developer and so it will probably take longer to have more code, and will do have some bugs. I'll try to keep it bug free but we all know that this is almost impossible :D
Anyone is free to fork this code and change it in anyway, and if you improve the code I just ask you to send me a pull request or tell me about the improvement done so that everyone using it can enjoy the same improvement ;)
